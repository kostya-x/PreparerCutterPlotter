I need this macro
for cutting plotter on a GCC Jaguar V.
The file will preparing the program CorelDraw X3.

--------------------------------------------------

To begin with, we make a correction of the cutting contour 0.3mm to the left and 0.5mm up.

Remove all guides.
(Otherwise the plotter will try to cut them)

Change the thickness of the cutting contour line to "Hairline".
(The plotter cuts only lines with that size)

Group the contour for cutting and change the color to R102 G51 B51
(Just a visual indicator that the macro worked)

--------------------------------------------------

Macro tested in CorelDraw X3 and X7ï»¿
